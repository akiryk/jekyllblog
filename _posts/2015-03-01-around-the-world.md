I recently role-hopped around my scrum team over the course of about 80 days — from developer to UX lead to product owner. Ah, the adventures I had!

How did it come about? What did I learn? What do I think?

I think it’s been great, and I’d recommend it to anyone — or almost anyone, as long as you like trying new things and are comfortable learning as you go. It’s great because it broadens your perspective. You approach problems from a different point of view. It’s a challenge. And it’s refreshing to break out of existing routines.

Since I was already comfortable doing front-end development, design, and user experience, the biggest challenge was stepping into the product owner role, so I’ll focus on that. First, I should explain how this happened.

Last year, I was living in France, doing freelance and working remotely for NPR on a few different projects. When I returned, they needed my front-end skills on a big responsive redesign project that was underway, so I joined the team as a front-end developer, throwing points, making commits, the whole deal.

It was a short-term gig, however, because of budgets and logistics and the fact that the organization needed UX leadership. Always passionate about user experience, I said yes to a new job — manager of user experience and design — starting in October. Hardly three weeks passed, however, when the product owner on the responsive project announced she was leaving!

Although I’d never been a product owner before, I’d demonstrated that I had the management, communication, and strategic-thinking abilities to do it well, so my boss asked me to step into the role as we began to search for a full time replacement. I said yes, thinking it would be an interesting experience.

Five months later.

Unless you’re already immersed in the agile world, the title “Product Owner” can sound kind of funny. The idea is that you “own” a product in the sense that you’re the decision maker for that product — you might consult with committees or stakeholders or customers, but you determine what to do. The phrase, “one wringable neck,” [although controversial](https://seantscott.wordpress.com/2014/03/26/the-fallacy-of-the-single-wringable-neck/), is often used to describe the product owner because everyone knows who to blame if things go wrong.

In the few months I’ve been doing this, I’ve been forced to stretch in new ways, speaking regularly with customers to understand their needs and concerns; speaking with stakeholders to get them on-board with my agenda; communicating with the developers to understand their issues and keep them engaged during a somewhat tumultuous period. And yes, it’s been tumultuous.

Not only did we lose an important product owner in October: we gained a new senior director of product for the organization just a few weeks later. We began development on a challenging new feature that had been promised to clients months before. And we started on-boarding customers to our new responsive theme every month by the dozens — even though the theme was still being developed and hadn’t been optimized for a number of needs shared by many of the newly onboarding stations.

Talk about being thrown into the fire.

### What did I learn?

Here are some of the things I’ve learned that I think will apply nicely to my work going forward, whether it’s design, user experience, or front-end development:

**Take control of your time**. In the past, I’ve always organized my time in a fairly ad hoc way — I know what I have to do and I do it. As product owner, I deal with almost two hundred station customers, so I’ve had to be strict about how I manage my schedule. Simple tricks work best: I keep a running list of to-do items in the Mac Reminders app, and I’m ruthless about removing things that don’t deserve attention. I block off time slots on my calendar for anything important — not just meetings. Do I need to spend an hour thinking about a problem? Add it to the calendar. Do I need to research something related to underwriting? Add it to the calendar. Not only do these strategies help me get work done efficiently, but they reduce stress by reassuring me that I’m on top of things.

**Be a salesman**. I’m not a natural salesman, but it helped a lot to employ sales tactics when trying to rally support for various decisions. Don’t start out by telling stakeholders or customers that they should want something because it’s so great. Start by asking what they’re trying to do — or what would make their job easier. Practice active listening. Then talk about ways you can help them now and are working to helping them further. But be honest. If you aren’t going to prioritize something, make that clear and explain your reasoning. Follow through.

**Cleanliness next to godliness**. Sure, it’s good to have a clean desk, but what I’m really getting at is the importance of having a clear and minimal set of short term objectives. As a product owner — at least one with a small team and a big set of objectives — you have to get good at identifying and removing anything extraneous. Trying to do ten things at once will fail. Trying to do two things at once won’t necessarily be much better. What one thing should you be doing right now? Do it well.

**Design skills always matter**. Even when you aren’t in a design role, being able to present information clearly counts a ton. I can’t tell you how many meetings I’ve been to where a few simple design principles have helped me bring people along with my thinking. People have been impressed because they expected same-old business-speak and powerpoint presentations. Clean, clear slides with a strong information hierarchy and relevant visuals goes far.

**Nobody’s got a magic bullet for integrating design with agile**. At least I haven’t found one yet. There’s certainly been a lot written and a lot tried around this issue, but the reality seems to be that it’s hard. I’d been hopeful that as product owner, I could lead our team to find a solution once and for all. We haven’t found it yet. My current thinking is this: the solution involves being flexible and using different tactics depending on circumstances. The tactics include using a sprint zero; having the whole team focus on one feature together; iterating rapidly between designer and developer.

Being product owner has been fun, frustrating, challenging, and intense. There were moments when I thought, gee, perhaps I should consider doing this fulltime. Brief moments. Ultimately, however, I was extremely pleased when our favorite candidate said yes to our offer of a permanent position. My time as p.o. will come to an end soon. I’m looking forward to focusing on the other aspects of product development.
